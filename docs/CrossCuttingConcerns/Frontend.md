# Frontend

## React vs. Angular 
  - React is more popular
  - Angular has a steeper learning curve
  - Angular is based TypeScript
  - We have some experience, no experience with Angular

Our choice: **React**

## TypeScript > JavaScript
  - especially in projects with multiple developers
  - less bugs caused by weird types
  - less documenatation, because one can guess a lot from just the type signatures
  
Our choice: **TypeScript**

## Styling
- TailwindCSS: CSS-only, no ready-made components
- Material UI vs. Bootstrap
  - Material UI has a very good React integration, Bootstrap can only be used through react-bootstrap which is a complete rewrite of Bootstrap from scratch specifially for React
  - Bootstrap is easier to learn
  - Material UI allows for more complex custom components
  - Integrating Bootstrap with react-router is non-trivial. Material UI on the other hand provides documentation for this integration.

Our choice: **Material UI**
